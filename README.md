# SlackChat
This is a connection bridge between Slackchat (a group chat website) and minecraft.

The website can be found here: https://slack.com/

To get your Web-API you need to have, create a folder (if its not their) called SlackChat and in it put a config file with the
config section: Slack-Service:
After the slack-service put in your web-api key that can be found by logging into your slack-chat
and click you name, then click "Profile & Account" after that click the home button on the very right,
and scroll down. You will see "Integrations" There. Click "+ Integration" and make it a outgoing webhook.
Take that key and put it in your Slack-Service.

Restart the server.
And now (only on that server) People in the slack can talk to the Slack Chat. Or people logged into the slackchat
can talk to the server! Have fun!
